## Projects
### Project 1: R Project for the following course: R and Python Programming
- Utilized R to clean and prepare a dataset for analysis, with the objective of providing a comprehensive analysis of global data science salaries. The analysis aimed to propose a competitive salary range for attracting top talent in future job postings.
- After data cleaning, statistical and visualization methods were applied to derive insights, and a concise PowerPoint presentation was created to summarize findings and suggested salary ranges.

### Project 2: Python Project for the following course: R and Python Programming
- Tasked with integration and analysis of multiple datasets, including both provided datasets and external sources, to identify the top five locations globally where salaries offer the highest value in relation to the cost of living. 
- Used Python in Jupyter Notebook for data wrangling, cleaning, and combining datasets to perform statistical analysis and create visualizations supporting conclusions.
- Incorporated external data on gender equality rankings to refine the analysis, ensuring that the recommended locations aligned with both cost of living considerations and personal criteria, such as gender-related quality of life factors.
